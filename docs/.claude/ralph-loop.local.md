## TASK: Darwin UI Component Library Showcase & Complete Documentation

### CORE DELIVERABLES

1. **Component Showcase Grid (Home/Landing)**
   - Grid layout displaying ALL components with variations (zoomed, scaled, normal)
   - Shimmer/shine effects, gradient overlays, glassmorphism touches
   - Sassy UI aesthetic with bold colors, smooth hover states
   - 2-3 full-viewport scroll sections with slide-up PowerPoint-style animations
   - Large sample dashboard section using existing components

2. **SVG Logo**
   - Simple Apple icon
   - iOS app icon style: rounded-rect (superellipse), transparent bg
   - Subtle shine/gloss gradient overlay

3. **Sidebar Component**
   - Build as reusable component in components directory
   - Proper navigation state, responsive collapse behavior

4. **Complete ALL Documentation Pages**
   - Introduction, Installation, Theming, Getting Started, etc.
   - Each page must have: working code examples, proper explanations, styled content
   - No placeholder text or empty sections

5. **Typography & Global Styles**
   - Select and apply cohesive font family globally
   - Establish clear hierarchy (headings, body, code, captions)
   - Nothing clips or breaks at any viewport (320px to 4K)

6. **Micro-interactions**
   - Every button, link, toggle, input must have hover/focus/active states
   - Smooth transitions on all interactive elements

7. **Responsiveness**
   - Layouts work at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 2560px+
   - No horizontal overflow, no cut-off content

8. **New Components**
   - Create any missing components needed for showcase
   - Each new component must have corresponding test file

### COMPLETION CHECKLIST

Before outputting COMPLETE, verify ALL:
- [ ] Minimal file count—consolidate where logical
- [ ] Clean code: single responsibility, DRY, no dead code
- [ ] Comments ONLY where complex logic requires explanation
- [ ] ALL pages have real content and working code samples
- [ ] ALL buttons/inputs have micro-interactions
- [ ] ALL new components have test files
- [ ] Responsive at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px, 2560px
- [ ] No console errors, no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Apple SVG logo exists with iOS-style appearance

Fix and iterate if ANY check fails.

Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> only when ALL checks pass.
