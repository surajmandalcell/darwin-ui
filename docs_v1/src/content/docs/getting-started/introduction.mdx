Darwin UI is a macOS-inspired dark theme React component library featuring glass-morphism aesthetics. It provides a cohesive set of components designed for building beautiful, modern web applications with a premium dark theme feel.

## Design Philosophy

### Dark Theme First
Darwin UI is designed with dark mode as the primary theme, featuring a near-black background (`hsl(0, 0%, 4%)`) that provides excellent contrast and reduces eye strain.

### Glass Morphism
Components utilize backdrop-blur effects, semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-white/10`), and subtle borders to create a modern glass-like appearance.

### Accessibility
Built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### Framework Agnostic Design
While some components leverage Next.js features, the core library works with any React 19 project.
